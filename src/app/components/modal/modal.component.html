        your changes won't be committed to the database, it will be handled in
        the front end, I wrote the requests but commented it, if you want to
        check the source code I'll happily sent it to you
        <br />
        <br />I did this so no body make any permanent changes or just mess
        around by deleting all the test articles,
        <br />
        <br />
        in other words: you are the one refresh admin now, peace :)
